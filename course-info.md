**Class GitHub repo:** https://www.github.com/laboon/cs1632  
**Required Text:** _A Friendly Introduction to Software Testing_ by Bill Laboon.
* This is a PDF and is available on Github
  * https://github.com/laboon/software-testing/blob/master/software-testing-laboon-ebook.pdf
* Note that it is subject to updates, as it is still undergoing review.
  * If you spot a typo or mistake, or suggest an improvement that I use, and file it as a pull request or issue on the source repository (ebook), you can get 0.5 extra percentage point (out of 100), up to 2 percentage points.
  * In other words, if you finish the semester with a 90, but submitted 4 valid issues / typo fixes / whatever, your final grade is 90 + 2, 92.

**Recommended Texts:** 

Test-Driven Development: By Example, Kent Beck ISBN-13: 978-0321146533

Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach, Paul Jorgensen, ISBN-13: 978-1466560680

I have both of these texts available for you to borrow.

This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern
software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing
theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software
testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual
and automated tests, test-driven and behavior-driven development,
performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing
process.

## Grading

* Mid-term Exam - 15%
* Final Exam - 15%
* Projects:
  * Deliverable 1 - 10%
  * Deliverable 2 - 10%
  * Deliverable 3 - 10%
  * Deliverable 4 - 10%
  * Deliverable 5 - 10%
  * Final Deliverable - 15%
* Class Participation - 5%

Although you are not required to come to every class (as you can see, it's technically possible to get an A without ever showing up except for turning in papers and tests), it is strongly recommended that you do.  I also expect students to take an active part in discussions.  Attendance _will_ be taken for project days, and this will count towards class participation.

The following grading scale will be used.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-94.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93.99-91.00  | A-
90.99-88.00  | B+
87.99-84.00  | B
83.99-81.00  | B-
80.99-78.00  | C+
77.99-74.00  | C
73.99-71.00  | C-
70.99-68.00  | D+
67.99-64.00  | D
63.99-61.00  | D-
60.99-0.00   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project, but
are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other
groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.

However, any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will
automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized
more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub by the beginning
of class on the due date.  Write-ups are due at the beginning of class.
Late assignments will not be accepted.

If any disputes from groups arise, I will assume that GitHub is the "ground 
truth".  

The final exam will be cumulative.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final
grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies
in grading.

## Attendance

Lecture attendance is not required, but is STRONGLY recommended.
The instructor will try to ensure that all information on the exams
will be available via slides, but simply reading them may be
insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly. 

Presence for group exercise days is required in order to get the full
class participation score.  These will not be rescheduled individually.

Presence for the mid-term and final exam are REQUIRED.  They will be
individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency.  If you
are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor IMMEDIATELY (if
it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for an exam
without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0
(zero) for that exam.

## Project Details

For deliverables 1, 3 and 5, groups of two will be assigned and will be
different each time.  For the final deliverable, you can choose to work
alone, or choose your own partner (who must, of course, also agree to work with you).  This partner can be someone with whom you have worked previously.

Students will perform the role of QA team on a project which can be selected either by themselves, or assigned by the instructor.  Although students can select to work on a different project, it must first be cleared with the instructor.  Additionally, it should be noted that the instructor and/or TA may not be able to help as much if you use a different project or language!    The group should check with the instructor as to the feasibility of
the particular project they are working on.  

* **Deliverable 1:** A test plan and traceability matrix
* **Deliverable 2:** Unit tests for a console-based application.
* **Deliverable 3:** Automated acceptance tests for a web application.
* **Deliverable 4:** Performance testing of an application.
* **Deliverable 5:** Security analysis of an application.
* **Final Deliverable:** Will vary based on the group.  See the Final Deliverable description for details of what is expected.

Deliverables must be handed in by close of class on the day that it is
due.  Late deliverables will NOT be accepted.

## Programming Language Selection

For deliverables 1 through 5, the class will use Java with the appropriate
frameworks (JUnit, Mockito, Selenium).  For the final project, student
groups are free to choose their own language/framework if they wish.
However, the professor may not be able to help them if he is not familiar
with the language/framework of their choice!

If you want to use Java but aren't a fan of Eclipse, information on setting up the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) with the required packages for this course can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/alexlafroscia/c6757de349b27e34eff6).
